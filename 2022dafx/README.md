# DAFx 2022 Tutorial

## Musical Instrument Sound Analysis, Transformation, and Resynthesis in the Sound Morphing Toolbox

## Quick Setup

1. Go to the folder that will be the base folder for the codebase (e.g., `dafx2022_base`)
2. Unzip the file DAFx_2022.rar inside `dafx2022_base`
3. Start Matlab
4. Add `dafx2022_base` and all its subfolders to the Matlab path
5. Run both the `DAFx2022_SFM.mlx` and the `DAFx2022_SM.mlx` files

## Description

Sound morphing requires the use of several audio processing algorithms involving the analysis, transformation, and resynthesis of sounds. The aim of this tutorial is to review the techniques implemented in the sound morphing toolbox (SMT). The SMT is open-source and freely available on [GitHub](https://github.com/marcelo-caetano/sound-morphing). In this tutorial, we will go over the analysis, transformation, and resynthesis steps used in standard morphing techniques applied to isolated notes from musical instrument sounds, such as sinusoidal modeling, spectral envelope estimation, time-scale modification, and resynthesis models. The tutorial will include sound examples to illustrate each step and a hands-on session to show the participants how to use the SMT.

## Pre-requisites

## Details

### Sinusoidal Model

### Source-Filter Model

## Products

The SMT requires the _signal processing toolbox_.
